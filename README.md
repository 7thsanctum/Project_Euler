Project Euler - Read Me
------------------------
This repo contains all of the working projects for the examples I have personally worked through so far. The primary languages I work in will be C++ and C#. I plan to perhaps try some of these examples in Javascript as well in the future and potentially other languages also just for fun.

Before you proceed any further I advise you to engage in the Project Euler challenge yourself without referring to other people's code first. By working through the problem's on your own first you will gain alot more knowledge and insight both about the language you are working in, the mathematical problem and your own level of knowledge. 

Remember Project Euler isn't a competition!

That said, feel free to refer to the code you find within and improve upon it if you like.

Requirements
-------------
The C# and C++ projects have been built in a combination of VS2010 and VS2012.
